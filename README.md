William's Battery is a powerful, multi-threaded Python-based toolkit designed for demonstrating and researching various Denial of Service (DoS) attack vectors. It can launch blended, simultaneous attacks to simulate a complex cyber-attack scenario for security testing and network infrastructure stress-testing.

The project was intended to serve as the "counterstrike" branch for an email scam identification software of a college SWE project.

üöÄ Features

Blended, Multi-Threaded Attacks: Launches UDP, TCP SYN, ICMP, and HTTP floods simultaneously to create a complex and effective attack simulation.

Multiple Flood Vectors:

UDP Flood: Saturates bandwidth and exhausts UDP-based services.

TCP SYN Flood: Aims to exhaust the server's connection state table.

ICMP Flood: A classic "Ping Flood" to saturate the network.

HTTP GET Flood: Overwhelms web server applications (Layer 7).

Configurable Attack Profiles:

Full Scale Counterstrike (Siege): A prolonged, high-volume attack across a wide range of ports and vectors.

Fast Counterstrike (Surgical Strike): A short, intense, and focused attack on the most critical services for maximum immediate impact.

Modular and Readable Code: The attack logic is separated into a helper module for clarity and easy extension.

‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites & Installation

To run this tool, you will need:

Python 3.8 or newer.

pip for installing packages.

Root or Administrator privileges to craft and send raw packets with Scapy.

Installation Steps:

Clone the repository:

Generated bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/williams-battery.git
cd williams-battery


Create a requirements.txt file in the project directory with the following content:

Generated code
scapy
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

Install the required Python packages:

Generated bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Bash
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
üïπÔ∏è Usage

The script is run from the command line and will prompt you for the target and attack profile.

IMPORTANT: You must run the script with sudo (on Linux/macOS) or as an Administrator (on Windows) for the SYN and ICMP floods to work correctly.

Generated bash
sudo python3 main.py
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Bash
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

The script will then guide you through the process:

üõ°Ô∏è Attack Profiles Explained
1. Full Scale Counterstrike (Siege)

This profile is designed for a sustained, overwhelming assault.

Duration: Long (e.g., 360 seconds per UDP attack).

Volume: Extremely high packet and request counts.

Scope: Broad. It targets a wide range of common ports for SYN floods and performs a UDP flood scan across the first 1024 ports.

Use Case: Simulating a persistent, large-scale DoS attack to test the long-term resilience of network infrastructure and mitigation systems.

2. Fast Counterstrike (Surgical Strike)

This profile is designed for a quick, high-impact burst.

Duration: Short (e.g., 60 seconds per UDP attack).

Volume: High, but lower than the siege profile, optimized for a fast-and-done attack.

Scope: Focused. It targets only the most critical service ports (Web, SSH, RDP, DNS) to maximize the chance of immediate disruption.

Use Case: Simulating a hit-and-run style attack or performing a quick stress test on primary services.

üèóÔ∏è Code Architecture

The project is structured for clarity and maintainability:

main.py: The entry point of the application. It handles user interaction (getting the target and profile choice) and calls the appropriate attack function.

counter_strike_helper.py: A module containing the core logic for each individual attack vector (attack_UDP, synflood, icmpflood, attack_http_flood). This separation of concerns makes the code easier to manage and extend.
